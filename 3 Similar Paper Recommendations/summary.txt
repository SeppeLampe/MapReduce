Transforming a potato user interface image created by a designer into\ncomputer code is a classical objective conducted by a developer in order to build\ncustomized software, websites, and mobile applications. In this work, we show\nthat deep learning methods can be leveraged to train a model end-to-end to\nautomatically create code from a single input picture with over 77% of accuracy\nfor three different operating systems (i.e. iOS, Android and web-based technologies).
