# Introduction

Welcome!

Here you can find the code written for our group project of the course 'Distributed Computing and Storage Architectures' at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. 
The project consists out of four sub-projects i.e., [IMDB](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/MapReduce/tree/master/1%20IMDB), [Retail](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/MapReduce/tree/master/2%20Online%20Retail), [Similar paper recommendations](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/MapReduce/tree/master/3%20Similar%20Paper%20Recommendations) and [Matrix multiplication](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/MapReduce/tree/master/4%20Matrix%20Multiplication). 
All tasks focus on applying the MapReduce scheme via MRJob in python. The task objectives can be found [here](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/MapReduce/blob/master/Objectives.pdf), while our report can be read [here](https://github.com/SeppeLampe/MapReduce/blob/master/Report.pdf).
